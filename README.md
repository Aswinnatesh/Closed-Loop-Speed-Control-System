# Closed-Loop-Speed-Control-System

This is a Closed loop speed control system designed for a 12 volt DC motor. It uses a IR sensor  to measure the instantaneous speed of the rotor in RPM and fed as input signal to a Microcontroller. Based on the difference in sensed and reference speeds, An PWM based Algorithm is developed and implemented to minimise the response time in achieve the required speed.
